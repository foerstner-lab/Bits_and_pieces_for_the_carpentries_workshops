In pandas, what is the primary purpose of the apply method when used with a DataFrame?
A) To create a new DataFrame with only selected columns.
B) To apply a function to each element or row in a DataFrame.
C) To group rows based on a specific column's values.
D) To filter rows based on a condition.
E) To sort the DataFrame in ascending order.

Correct Answer: B) To apply a function to each element or row in a DataFrame.

Explanation: The apply method in pandas is primarily used to apply a
function (provided as an argument) to each element or row in a
DataFrame. It is a powerful tool for transforming data, performing
element-wise operations, or aggregating data within a DataFrame. While
options (A), (C), (D), and (E) describe some common DataFrame
operations, they are not the primary purpose of the apply method.


In pandas, how does the apply method behave differently when applied to a Series compared to a DataFrame?
A) When applied to a Series, apply can only operate on a single element at a time, while on a DataFrame, it operates on entire rows or columns.
B) When applied to a Series, apply always returns a Series, while on a DataFrame, it can return a DataFrame or a Series, depending on the function used.
C) When applied to a Series, apply cannot accept user-defined functions, while on a DataFrame, it can.
D) When applied to a Series, apply can only be used to aggregate data, while on a DataFrame, it can perform element-wise operations.
E) There is no difference in how the apply method behaves between Series and DataFrames in pandas.

Correct Answer: A) When applied to a Series, apply can only operate on a single element at a time, while on a DataFrame, it operates on entire rows or columns.

Which pandas function is commonly used to create basic visualizations, such as line plots and bar charts, directly from a DataFrame or Series?
A) plot()
B) visualize()
C) draw()
D) chart()
E) show()

Correct Answer: A) plot()

Explanation: The plot() function in pandas is commonly used for creating basic visualizations like line plots, bar charts, histograms, and more from a DataFrame or Series.

Which parameter in the plot() function allows you to specify the type of plot to create, such as 'line', 'bar', or 'hist'?
A) style
B) kind
C) type
D) plot_type
E) plot_style

Correct Answer: B) kind

Explanation: The kind parameter in the plot() function is used to specify the type of plot to create. It accepts values like 'line', 'bar', 'hist', 'scatter', etc.

In pandas, what is the purpose of the xlabel and ylabel parameters when creating a plot using the plot() function?
A) They set the plot title.
B) They specify the legend labels.
C) They control the axis labels.
D) They define the plot color.
E) They determine the plot style.

Correct Answer: C) They control the axis labels.

Explanation: The xlabel and ylabel parameters in the plot() function are used to specify the labels for the x-axis and y-axis, respectively.

Which of the following statements is true regarding the plot() function in pandas?
A) It only works with numerical data.
B) It cannot create 3D plots.
C) It requires an external plotting library like Matplotlib.
D) It doesn't support customization of plot styles.
E) It can only create scatter plots.

Correct Answer: B) It cannot create 3D plots.

Explanation: The plot() function in pandas primarily creates 2D plots. For 3D plots, you would typically need an external plotting library like Matplotlib.

Which method can be used to save a plot created with the plot() function to a file in pandas?
A) save_plot()
B) export_to_file()
C) to_image()
D) savefig()
