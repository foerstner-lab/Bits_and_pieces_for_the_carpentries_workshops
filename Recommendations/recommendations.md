### Requirements for a Good Editor/IDE
- Save and Reload Source Code 
    - An IDE or editor must save your work and reopen everything later, in the same state it was in when you left, thus saving time for development.
- Execution from Within the Environment
    - It should have a built-in compiler to execute your code. If you are not executing it in the same software, then probably it is a text editor. 
- Debugging Support
    - The debugger in most IDEs provides stepping through your code and applying breakpoints for the code's partial execution. 
- Syntax Highlighting
    - Being able to spot keywords, variables quickly, and symbols in your code make reading and understanding code much easier.
- Automatic Code Formatting
    - This is an interesting feature; the code indents itself as the developer uses loops, functions, or any other block code.

### text editors/IDEs (integrated development environment)

### How to run python in the Git Bash on Windows
```
$ winpty <path-to-python-installation-dir>/python.exe
```

### Workaround if Anaconda doesn't work
Go to https://mybinder.org/. Put the URL
https://github.com/foerstner-lab/Bits_and_pieces_for_the_carpentries_workshops
after "GitHub repository name or URL" and write
"empty_jupyter_notebook_for_binder.ipynb" after "Path to a notebook
file".

Click on "launch" .
